# Task 5: Data Analysis on CSV Files

## Description
This project analyzes a sales dataset using Python and Pandas to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes aggregation, summarization, and visualization of data to understand trends, totals, and patterns in sales.

## Objective
Analyze sales data using Python and Pandas to gain actionable insights.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with data analysis
- Visualizations / charts for insights

## Mini Guide / Hints
1. **Load CSV data using Pandas:**
python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("your_file.csv")


## 2. Use groupby() and sum() to aggregate data:
sales_summary = df.groupby("Category")["Sales"].sum()

## 3.Create plots to visualize insights:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sales_summary.plot(kind="bar")
plt.show()

## Outcome:
Gain basic insights from the sales data
Understand trends, totals, and patterns using Python and Pandas

## How to Run
1.Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Pravalikapole/your-repo.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter or Colab.
3. Execute the cells step by step to see the analysis and charts.
